          <h1>L'exp√©rience de Pronto Letzgeaux</h1>
          <img src='img/splashline.svg' class='line'>
          <p>Pronto Letzgeaux offers its visitors the rare opportunity to
            join two acclaimed young chefs at the dinner table for an evening
            of Franco-Italian cuisine. Chefs Sofia and Gabriel Durand accompany
            their dinner guests throughout the evening, providing insight,
            instruction, and entertainment throughout. Guests at Pronto
            Letzgeaux dine like friends and family around a single ten-seat
            table, and dinner typically comprises seven courses. Anticipate
            joining the Durands for two to three hours and making a few new
            friends in the process.</p>
          <p>Chef Gabriel was born, raised, and trained in Lyon, France, where
            he met Chef Sofia, a chef's apprentice on vacation from Milan,
            Italy. Their cuisine is a celebration of their backgrounds,
            marrying the nuanced French style with the passionate Italian.
            Diners can expect alternation between French and Italian dishes,
            with the primo and secondo implementing both methods for truly
            singular results.</p>
          <p>Reservations are handled by the Durands themselves and can be
            requested through the form on the Seats page. Sofia and Gabriel
            will work to accommodate your requests and will contact you as
            quickly as possible.</p>
