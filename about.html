          <h1>Sofia</h1>
          <img src='img/aboutline.svg' class='line'>
          <p>Sofia was born in Abbiategrasso, a small town mere minutes from
            bustling Milan, Italy. At sixteen she began an apprenticeship in the
            city, and at eighteen she took on a series of jobs in Venice,
            Florence, and Rome, each more prestigious than the last.
            During her second tenure in Florence she took a weekend vacation to
            Lyon, where she met Gabriel. The two were immediately inseparable.</p>

          <h1>Gabriel</h1>
          <img src='img/aboutline.svg' class='line'>
          <p>Gabriel was born, raised, and trained in Lyon, France, learning
            his craft under the tutelage of legendary Chef Paul Bocuse. One
            week after meeting Sofia, he left Lyon to join her in Florence, and
            the two soon eloped and immigrated to America. After an extended
            tour of both American coasts, the Durands made Providence, Rhode
            Island their new home. Shortly thereafter Pronto Letzgeaux
            welcomed its first guests.</p>
